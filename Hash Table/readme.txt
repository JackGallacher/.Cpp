This is a simple has table that I made that allows you to input your data (hardcode only) and saves it to the hash tabe when the program is started. The program then automatically displays the data to show that the table has worked.

This is more of a proof of concept rather than a fully functioning program, It gave me good practice and an insight into this method of data storage regardless.
